# Overview

This program is more of a testing environment integrated with a cloud database. Through this program, it inserts, modifies, deletes, and retrieves data placed and stored in the Firestore database. Cloud data storage is a smart solution removing any requirement for individuals or companies in maintaining a database server on premises. 

Due to the program being a testing environment, this ensures the possibility of integrating an actual database of either employees within a company or a complex library containing books with their brief info.

# Cloud Database

Firebase is the cloud database currently in play with this testing environmnet. It's a platform developed by Google to creating mobile and web application. It helps build and run those apps successfully. App development is accelarated with a fully manage backend infrastructure. Several features are the following:

**Build**
* Authentication
* Cloud Firestore
* Storage
* Hosting
* Machine Learning
* Realtime Database

**Release & Monitor**
* App Distribution
* Crashlytics
* Performance
* Test Lab

**Engage**
* Cloud Messaging
* Predictions
* Remote Config
* A/B Testing
* Dynamic Links
* In-App Messaging

The structure to the database is a mix of auto identifiers and set names. At first, there will be a People category in which contains either unique identifiers or random ones. Throughout this, we have information of a person with their name, age, employed, and residence.

# Development Environment

Tools used to develop this program:
* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.8.4 with the Firebase library
* Firebase Cloud  Database

Program contains a main.py and a JSON file for testing purposes.

# Future Work

* Organize it better for future references.
* Insert a loop to facilitate the deciding process of whether to add, modify, insert, or delete data.
* Integrating this environment into a small working database to simulate any real-life situations.
